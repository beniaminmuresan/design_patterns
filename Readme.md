# Creational design patterns
### Abstract Factory Method [(code example)](./abstract_factory.rb)
- is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
### Factory Method a.k.a Virtual Constructor [(code example)](./factory.rb)
- provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

### Builder [(code example)](./builder.rb)
- is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.
